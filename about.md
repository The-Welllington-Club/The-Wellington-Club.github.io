The Wellington Club was established in April 2019 by a committee of Junior Officers, Colonel Reserves and former LONDIST YODA.

TWC's three core aims are as follows:
* To provide an environment for junior officers in London to network, share ideas and cross-collaborate more effectively;
* To nurture and welcome potential officers into the Reserves; and,
* To influence policy through engagement with senior officials within the British Army.

TWC is managed by an executive committee of seven junior officers and two non-executive senior officer advisers. The committee represents different Corps across the Army Reserves and is committed to organising and running various events for members throughout the year. Such events include fireside chats with senior officers and distinguished guest speakers, tours of interest sites, and an annual mess dinner. TWC offers full membership to any reservist officer, from Second Lieutenant to Junior Captain either based, or working, in London, and offers provisional membership to all potential officers with an AOSB pass within London.
> All the business of war, and indeed all the business of life, is to endeavour to find out what you don't know by what you do; that's what I called "guessing what was at the other side of the hill." Duke of Wellington
